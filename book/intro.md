# Introduction

This project servers as a memory dump of my head. It contains more or less structured data about the technology
I'm lerning about and as such the primary purpose of it is to help me remind of details which would others go away.
Although it's trying to be correct it is by no means perfect. It's subject of continuous changes as I get deeper and
deeper in the topics.

The goal is to create a Linux specific Rust standard library and learn from the project as much as possible.
